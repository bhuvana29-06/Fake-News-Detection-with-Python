# Fake-News-Detection-with-Python
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that can automatically detect whether a news article is Fake or Real. With the rapid growth of online news platforms and social media, misinformation spreads quickly. This system helps identify misleading content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
